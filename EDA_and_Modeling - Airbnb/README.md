### Overview

Airbnb is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences since 2008. NYC is the most populous city in the United States and also one of the most popular tourism and business place in the world. The data contains listing activity and metrics. 

The main objective for the analysis is to understand how different aspects influence the price, such as the location, reviews, and what makes a host more or less popular.
Also we want to recommend a reasonable price for its users, in case those users are going to list proprieties to be rented at their platform. All of this could help providing a better user experience for a wide range of customer groups.
